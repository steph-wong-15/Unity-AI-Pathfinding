This project was done with the use of Unity.

The goal of this project was to create an environment and used NavMesh aand waypoints to allow the NPC to find the optimal path between two locations. I designed the environment as an enclosure with several different rooms and obstacles.
The first is the futuristic start room where the NPC, Cactus Guy starts off. He moves through a radioactive area, through a maze, and finally to the outside destination.
